Universal Die Set

Whether you're playing a D&D-based RPG or a GURPS RPG you need dice. A lot of them. And you might not always know exactly which ones you need. With this project you'll have a coin toss, 4, 8, 10, 12, 20, and 100-sided die at your fingertips â€“ oh and need more than one six-sided die? Toss up to 9 at a time. 

Parts list: 
Arduino (I used a Pro Nano from Sparkfun)
LED Display (4 digit 7 segment display, also from Sparkfun)
16 position rotator switch with knob (Sparkfun)
pizeo-electric sensor (Sparkfun)
push button (panel mount, spark fun)
(power switch)
4AAA battery holder enclosed, with switch ($2 Radio Shack)
Enclosure (I'm using a Newman's Own Cinnamon Mints tin, exactly the same size as an Altoids tin)
Electrical and double-stick tape
hook-up wire
Silicone caulk
heat shrink tubing

Tools: 
Dremel
soldering iron (+solder)
Pliers
diagnol cutters
wire stripper

Prototyping: 

I laid out all the functionality on a breadboard while my nano and switches were in transit. This allowed me to develop my code in a known environment (since I've done lots of projects with my Duemilnova, and jumper wires are much easier to trace than a new potentiometer. 

The Duemilnove and Nano have 6 Analog inputs and 14 digital input/outputs. 

Inputs for the system are: 
4 pins from the dial
1 pin from the push button
1 analog level from the piezo sensor

Since I have 6 inputs and one of them is analog, I decided to put all my inputs on the analog pins. For the digital inputs on the potentiometer, this simply means listening for a signal above a certain threshold instead of listening for an open/close. Not a big deal. 

Outputs for the system are the 16 pins of my LED display bar. I could have used a driver board to reduce the number of outputs, instead I tied the separator dots to always be on and all the decimal points to always be off.
